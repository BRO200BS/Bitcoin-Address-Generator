Bitcoin All Type Address Generator ! Generates Bitcoin addresses of different types (uncompressed and compressed P2PKH addresses, P2SH addresses, and Bech32 addresses) using a cryptographically secure method. It prompts the user to enter the number of addresses to generate and creates them using the os, ecdsa, base58, Crypto.Hash, and bech32 libraries.  First, the code generates a private key using the os.urandom function to generate 32 bytes of random data. This private key is then encoded in Wallet Import Format (WIF) by adding a version byte (0x80 for mainnet), calculating a checksum using double SHA-256 hashing, and encoding the result in base58.  Next, the code uses the ecdsa library to derive a public key from the private key. The public key is a point on the elliptic curve defined by the secp256k1 parameters. The code calculates both the uncompressed and compressed forms of the public key. The uncompressed public key includes both the x and y coordinates of the point, while the compressed public key includes only the x coordinate and a prefix to indicate whether the y coordinate is even or odd.  The code then generates a P2PKH address from the uncompressed public key by performing SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashing on the public key, adding a version byte (0x00 for mainnet), calculating a checksum using double SHA-256 hashing, and encoding the result in base58. A compressed P2PKH address is generated in a similar manner using the compressed public key.  A P2SH address is generated by creating a redeem script that includes the compressed public key, performing SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashing on the redeem script, adding a version byte (0x05 for mainnet), calculating a checksum using double SHA-256 hashing, and encoding the result in base58.  Finally, a Bech32 address is generated by converting the RIPEMD-160 hash of the compressed public key into a witness program with a version byte of 0x00 and a length of 20 bytes, converting the witness program from 8-bit to 5-bit format using the convertbits function from the bech32 library, and encoding the result using Bech32 with the human-readable part bc for mainnet.  The code returns a dictionary containing all generated information (private key, WIF, public key, compressed public key, P2PKH address, compressed P2PKH address, P2SH address, and Bech32 address) for each generated address.
